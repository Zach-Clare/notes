This was originally going to be about my daily walks, but I think there's something more fundamental at play than just the walk itself. Most days that I work from home (and even on days I go to the office), it has become part of my tradition to go on a quick 20 minute walk around sunset. 

Recently, I've left my phone at home and taken only my keys.

While it's not exactly ground breaking, its quite refreshing not feeling it in my pocket, and there's a part of me that's embarrassed about how different it makes me feel. It's even a little bit exciting. I'm completely unconnected to everything not in my eyesight. Thinking about doing this invokes a small panic response in me, something along the lines of "what if someone needs me?". And yet, every time I turn the lock to get back into my home, everything is exactly the same as when I'd left. 

I'm lucky enough to live very close to farmland with a public footpath going through it. Today I saw sheep, horses, birds, and even a fox and two deer scurry over the hill at my sight. The sun shone through the tops of the wheatgrass and lit them up a striking deep red and made old, wrinkled tree trunks glow a forgotten maroon brown. At one point, I felt compelled to take out my phone to take a photo. I won't say that it reminded me to just "live in the moment" because, although he moment was beautiful, it didn't. I was just annoyed I couldn't take the photo.

This happens nearly every time actually, and still I leave my phone at home just because of how novel and freeing it feels to have empty pockets. It has been happening less and less though, and I have felt more present in just enjoying the sights.

There is one thing I'll try to do every time if I remember, and that's to just listen. At some point I decided to start closing my eyes as well. I'm not entirely sure why, but I seem to be able to pay much more attention to the sounds of things when I close my eyes. I'll suddenly become very aware of which huddle of trees some particular birdsong is coming from. I'll suddenly hear the horses pulling on the grass with their teeth. And I will also become aware of how there is almost always the sound of a plane going overhead.

I'm sure I can close my eyes or not take photos while having my phone in my pocket, but I think it's the idea of putting a physical barrier between you and the sources of your distractions and anxieties. Perhaps there are other ways for me to implement that idea into my life, with people and routines that I want less of. Perhaps when I do, I'll write about it again.
