I'm unsure what prompted me to make this change in my life, but it was likely a few things. Stories of people's final conversations over the phone with a friend before their untimely death. The deep and sincere awe for life that disappears scarcely before it begins. A rejection of "coolness" in favour of authenticity.

Some started immediately saying it back, as if they were waiting for someone else to say it first. Others weren't as freely giving and seemed to get caught up on the words. You can tell when someone isn't used to it or feels strange about saying it, even when the friendship is decades old, because it's what I felt for a long time until recently. 

The people who choose to say it back have been surprising and not entirely the ones who I would expect to wholeheartedly reciprocate. There have been others that I thought it would become commonplace with, and it hasn't yet.

But it is freeing to more consciously recognise the need for love and care on levels other than romantic. In truth, placing the source of all love on one romantic partner is a lot of pressure, and we need to feel valued from many places to feel completely whole.

I'm still getting better at using my actions to more rewardingly care about those in my life. Being open and honest with my words is a great first step towards that goal. These [[Mini-essays||mini-essays]] are another intentional step forwards.

Now whenever I'm hanging up the phone, sharing advice, or clinking my glass in a sunny pub garden, a sense of quiet peace momentarily blossoms inside of me. I can only imagine it does for my friends, too.
