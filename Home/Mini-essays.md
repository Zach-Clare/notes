This is the idea that started all of this. I watched a video on YouTube from a creator that I'll name later. He talked about how he writes mini-essays about whatever he's working on or learning about in a particular day. 

He argued that more people should try this out and that it was easier to retain information once you've written about it (which I agree with). I'm not doing this solely to better retain information, but I think that will be an added upshot for me. I think I'm doing this to be a bit better in tune with myself. 

It's a form of journaling I suppose. There isn't going to be a lot of talk about my feelings or anxieties - I much prefer pen and paper for that. But writing with half of an intention to share will make me want to write about positive, or at least important things. I like the idea of this because it refocuses my attention on something that I think is special, using time that I would otherwise just spend on my phone or watching an extra episode of some TV series. 

I'm not expecting this to be something I do every day, at least in my free time. For work, adding an entry on days that I'm able could be a great way to reinforce my learning and keep on top of things. Maybe I'll start adding recipes or review books with this. It opens up potential for all of that and more, so let's put our shoes on and see where this goes.

A good side effect is that my writing skills will improve. While I have a good handle on grammar and spelling, my actual construction of written arguments, along with brevity, is very poor. This is something that, with effort, will get better.

Also, I love the idea of having a synced version of this on a USB that I carry around with me. Maybe as a necklace or a cool-looking flash drive on my keyring. Just for fun.
