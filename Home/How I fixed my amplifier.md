The 1/4" jack was cracked laterally, across the face of the socket but about 10mm down. The board reads ELNA 94HB, which only returns sewing machines and very old and niche PDFs. 

I have a few 3.5mm jacks that I could've soldered on via some jumper cables, but there was no way to then mount that to the inside face of the unit so you could plug in the jack without pushing it into the box. 

Instead, I bought some plastic glue, inserted the 3.5mm to 1/4" jack into the socket (to retain shape/tension), and glued it together again. This will only last so long, so I will need to re-solder the socket at some point.

These old amplifiers are amazing. They're so cheap and easy to fix, and they sound incredible. God, I love them.
