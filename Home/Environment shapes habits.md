Space dictates activities, to an extent. Yes - willpower and desire largely shape what you decide to do with your time, but barriers between you and good habits will make it harder to get into those good habits. 

Fortunately, the same applies to bad habits, and we can use that to our advantage. 

I spend a lot of time on my desktop computer at home, and while I achieve some very good things there, it sometimes outstays its welcome. It draws me into a current that keeps be there. I wouldn't call it a *grip* because it's affect is soft and seldom noticed. It breeds on passivity, on the lack of intended direction from me, or from you.

My problem can be helped with a bit of environment shaping. Take my downstairs lounge for example. I made the decision to not have a TV, and put a piano it it's place. Now, when the kettle is boiling, when the pot is stewing, or when a friend is still tying their shoes, a few lonely notes ring out and occasionally dance into a song. It's a form of little treat, brought to life via the instrument's accessibility. 

Here, when the mind wanders and my attention becomes passive, it is easy to play the piano. Just as it becomes easy to stay on my computer. 

I'm still exploring to what extent this idea true, but I have been having positive results so far, and I'm excited to apply this to other aspects of my life. Good things are coming, and the lessons I'm learning about myself as I grow up make me hopeful.
