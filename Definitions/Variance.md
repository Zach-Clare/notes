The variance of a population is the mean average of the squares of the [[Deviation||deviation]] for all samples.
$$
\begin{equation*}
deviation = x - mean
\end{equation*}

^^^^^ add the big greek E to say for every value in dataset, minus the average, then square. The variance is the average of these squares.

Considered a [[Summary Statistics||summary statistic]].
