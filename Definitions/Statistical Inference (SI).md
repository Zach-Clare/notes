This is the process of using statistics and data analysis to understand a population. Estimation uses certain parameters about the population (along with a confidence interval e.g. between 0.5 and 0.7) to draw conclusions. Hypothesis testing uses claims (hypotheses) and Boolean answers to draw conclusions.

It says on the [W3 Schools page on Statistical Inference](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/statistics_statistical_inference.php) that this practise relies on probability calculations and probability distributions. I assume this is talking about the bell curve and goes on to talk about standard deviation, but I don't have time to fully investigate this.
