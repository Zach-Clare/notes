These are mathematical or computational models that explain how things work. They simulate the underlying physics interactions that drive the system being simulated, and can describe the whole system using the combination of the simulated constituent parts.

They're distinct from empirical models, which are not aware of the underlying processes and use equations to simulate behaviour.
