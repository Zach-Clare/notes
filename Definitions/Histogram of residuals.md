This is a histogram plot of the [[Residuals||residuals]] generated by your dataset.

The histogram shows bias in under or overestimation around zero. The closer to zero it is, the better the collection of fits are. This method ignores differences in magnitude and shows only absolute difference, irrespective of initial values. For example, if the fit was very inaccurate at estimating truths with large values, you won't be able to tell from this plot. Charalambos has offered help if you want to find a histogram that does that.


To work out which direction your fit is skewed in, check how you've calculated your [[Residuals||residual]]. If you have taken your truth from your fit, a negative residual shows your method underestimates the end value, and vice versa.

Here's an example:
