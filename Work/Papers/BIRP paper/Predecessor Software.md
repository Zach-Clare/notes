*We should probably talk about Read and Sembay's software in further detail*
*Why not use existing rendering software? VTK? Not sure how to answer yet, but something with not wanting RBG values that we'd get from a shader. Wanting physical count values. Yes, could use a compute shader. We didn't because of time/funding restraints, and on many machines, there wouldn't have been much difference. That could be considered if taking this software further, e.g. VR real-time rendering. Too much detail probably.*

I mean, we've already talked about Read's software surely? Maybe we just go more into time differences, methodology differences, perhaps portability as well.

Then compare with VTK. Scope, requirements, with the ML pipeline in mind. Time/funding constraints. 

Maybe talk about using a compute shader in future and what that could unlock. Or keep that for the end??
