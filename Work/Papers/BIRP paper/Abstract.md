This paper presents a program purpose-built for the SMILE mission that uses known graphical rendering techniques to create line-of-sight integrations through MHD output or CMEM in under 50 milliseconds on consumer-grade hardware. The core technique of sampling the data along a set of pixel rays builds up a final image of emissivity from the data, and can be used as part of a machine learning process or to intuitively visualise simulation results. This software is applicable as a general software renderer and functions with only a single CPU core, making it ideal for use with parallel or distributed computing techniques.
