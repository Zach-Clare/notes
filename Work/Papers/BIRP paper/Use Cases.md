*Where is this useful?*
*What are the intended use cases*
*And what is this applicable for, out-of-the-box?*

*This is useful for visualising simulator output results as it's a more intuitive understanding than slicing*
*Because it's quick, it's useful for the described role inside a machine learning process*
*It's also applicable for other volume rendering cases, provided they're in the correct format, such as Hamish, Lucie*

Using CMEM, this software can render the images required during SMILE's Level 4 process in under a second on a consumer-grade laptop. The entire rendering process takes only a single core on the CPU, meaning that this software can be utilised especially well with parallel machine learning methods to allow for a quicker fit. This is useful because SMILE aims to find the magnetopause subsolar standoff position with a 5 minute resolution, and this will allow for real-time processing of that data.  
.......Other  information is required, such as the location of the spacecraft and the dipole tilt of the Earth at the time the data product was captured, but this can be easily retrieved.

The renderer can also allow for an intuitive understanding when used alongside with sliced images when visualising magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model output. This makes it applicable in a much wider field, including coronal mass ejection simulations and engineering applications.

SMILE's Level 4 data products will science values describing the magnetopause subsolar distance. It's possible to use machine learning methods to find this value. Consider the Level 3 SXI images as an input a machine learning process where many instances of CMEM are instantiated and rendered to a 2 dimensional image.
