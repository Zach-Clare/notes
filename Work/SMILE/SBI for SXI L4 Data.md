Would it be useful to use [[Simulation Based Inference (SBI)]] for SMILEs SXI instrument for the purpose of forward modelling?

[[The frontier of simulation-based inference (2020)||This paper]] describes [[Simulation Based Inference (SBI)||SBI]] and how it is developing (changing) the scene for modelling in general. ATOW, I'm still going through that paper to fully understand the workflow of [[Simulation Based Inference (SBI)|SBI]] but I hope to have more information soon.
